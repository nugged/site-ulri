Ukrainian Libraries help and post-war Restoration Initiative

Our goal is to help Ukrainian libraries to restore,
from buildings to collections, but also IT infrastructure,
after the war, and start serving Ukrainians to rebuild
the future. We want to start preparing for this now.

We will unite and connect worldwide libraries and government
organizations for this goal and now call you to join.
Let us know how you can be helpful and what your ideas are,
and follow us to receive our requests for action and our proposals,
needs, and requirements. We need money, hands, and brains,
so everyone is welcome to join please.

Among these, because our community consists of Perl and Koha enthusiasts,
we tend to reorganize the IT part and help Ukrainian libraries switch
to Koha countrywide, centralized, and with strong support from both
Perl and Koha Communities. We also target to help Ukraine to grow
Perl and Koha Open Source team to combine efforts with worldwide Community.
